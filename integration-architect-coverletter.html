      <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

      <p>
        I am writing to apply for the <strong>Azure Integration Solutions Architect</strong> position at
        <strong>The Virtual IT Professional Inc.</strong> I bring over <strong>12 years of experience</strong> delivering custom-built
        enterprise solutions, with deep specialization in <strong>Azure-based integration architectures</strong> developed and validated
        in large-scale, production environments.
      </p>

      <p>
        A key foundation of my integration expertise was built at <strong>Accenture</strong>, where I architected and delivered
        enterprise-grade, event-driven Azure solutions within a global professional services context. I designed integration
        architectures leveraging <strong>Azure Functions, API Management, Service Bus, Event Hub, and Event Grid</strong>, which were
        tested to scale up to <strong>approximately 400,000 messages per minute</strong> while maintaining reliability, security, and performance.
        This work was later <strong>published as a customer case study on the Avanade website</strong>, reflecting real-world scalability and production readiness.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my current role as <strong>Solutions Architect at MediCard Philippines</strong>, I design secure and scalable Azure-based solutions
        within a regulated healthcare environment. My responsibilities include <strong>solution scoping and estimation</strong>, end-to-end solution design,
        defining integration patterns, and working closely with business, engineering, QA, and security teams to ensure solutions meet functional,
        performance, and compliance requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am particularly drawn to The Virtual IT Professional Inc. because of your focus on practical, client-facing Azure integration solutions.
        I value architecture that is proven in real workloads, designed to scale, and delivered collaboratively with cross-functional teams.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience designing high-throughput Azure
        integration architectures can support your clients and delivery teams.
      </p>
